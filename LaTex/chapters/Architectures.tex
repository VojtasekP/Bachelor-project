Neurons serve as the fundamental units of the nervous system, facilitating the transportation of information between the external world, our muscles and brain. The initial concept of creating an artificial neuron capable of imitating real neuron behaviour was proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. The most basic neural network known today was presented by M. Minsky and S. Papert in 1969. It consisted of a single layer and used a non-linear activation function for the output. However, they received significant criticism as the perceptron is working as linear binary classifier and is unable to learn the XOR function. This shortcoming was one of the factors behind the decline in interest in the development of artificial intelligence, a period known as the AI winter.
